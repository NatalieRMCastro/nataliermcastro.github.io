Music is at the center of popular culture. As a historic representation of the development 
of subcultures throughout differing political and social climates. Through the youth movement in 
the late 1960s, festivals like Woodstock notorious for their drug usage, and the drug epidemic of 
the 1990s, music has represented every transition in United States culture. The Billboard Hot 100 
has captured music most important to consumers. Compiled through physical and digital sales, 
radio airtime, and US streaming Billboard publishes a weekly list of the top 100 songs within 
this scoring system. Billboard has made all tracks available through their website, since the 
origination of the chart in 1958. Intended to complement prior literature, my research question is: 
how are popularity, time, and genre demonstrated through potential drug mentions in song titles?
