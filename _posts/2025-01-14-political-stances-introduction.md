Climate change has become an increasingly polarizing issue through partisan lines – and increasing in recent decades. Partisan views have developed into a social identity of sorts, thus many controversial topics have become amalgamated into believing the ‘Democrat’ or ‘Republican’ view of such debates (Dunlap et al., 2016). Historically environmental protections have received bi-partisan support, yet after the 2008 election, perceptions began to change (Dunlap et al., 2016). The increase in access to mass media may contribute to increasing political polarization too. Liberal leaning news sources are more likely to report upon climate change action, while conservative news sources challenge this – a recent headline from Fox News illustrates this: “Dems blame LA fire on 'climate change' despite city cutting fire department budget” (Adame et al., 2025; Spady, 2025). Mass media specifically contributes a significant role in shaping partisan beliefs about climate change (Adame et al., 2025).

			Donald Trump has become president, now for the second time, leading a Republican Trifecta, with control over the Huse, Senate, and Presidency. This positions him to make big changes to current climate change policy. The Republican party tends to away from policies which attempt to mitigate climate change and, in some cases, pass policy which specifically destructs the Democrat’s attempt to climate policy. An example of this is his recent policy to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement, impacting the views of peer countries (such as China) to take action against climate change (Dunlap et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2025). Further expectations about Trump’s climate policy are roll backs for chemical regulations and other types of pollution citing the economy as his main motivation (Jones et al., 2025). </p>

In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was passed by the Senate, totaling over 300 billion dollars to invest in global warming (Yearwood, 2022). This bill is claimed as “critical to humanity”, as climate change is viewed by many as something which impacts many people across the world (Yearwood, 2022). Furthermore, this bill supports clean energy, electric vehicle tax credits, and broader emission goals. </p>

Donald Trump’s plans for office aim to directly disassemble the effort by the Democrats, claiming “to further defeat inflation, my plan will terminate the Green New Deal, which I call the Green New Scam… and [I will] rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act” (Martínez, 2024). Not only is the Republican Party anti-climate change, they actively block and dismantle what policy the Democrat Party passes – this is not new to the Trump Era either, during 2008 a ‘sturdy legislate wall’ was established against the Obama Administration (Dunlap et al., 2016). Are these partisan divides present in citizen behavior as well or do these generalizations result on pluralistic ignorance? Dixon et al says no – with four out of five climate change polices (tax credits for carbon capture, powerplant restrictions, solar panel and wind turbine farms) received fifty percent or more of public approval (Dixon et al., 2024). However, these findings are contested by Gallup polls, which demonstrate over half of Republican Voters believe that “the seriousness of global warming is generally exaggerated in the news” and only 41% of Republican voters believe the “effects of global warming have already begun” (Dunlap et al., 2016).
