This positions him to make big changes to current climate change policy. The Republican party tends to away from policies which attempt to mitigate climate change and, in some cases, pass policy which specifically destructs the Democrat’s attempt to climate policy. An example of this is his recent policy to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement, impacting the views of peer countries (such as China) to take action against climate change (Dunlap et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2025). Further expectations about Trump’s climate policy are roll backs for chemical regulations and other types of pollution citing the economy as his main motivation (Jones et al., 2025). </p>

Thus, it will provide further insight about how money is managed, and the internal politics which occur on a board. The increased polarization, and local control of school boards results in different results in different educational policies. Many scholars argue, this kind of decision making happens in executive sessions, and behind closed doors. This increases curiosity about how gender dynamics may impact personal agendas. I hope to focus myresearch on how board meetings can be utilized as a form of data. Their conversation is archived through YouTube meetings allowing for transcripts and their representaion to be further analyzed. Board discussion is a confounding variable beyond traditional characteristics of recorded education data.</p>
