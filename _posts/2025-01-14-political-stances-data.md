The data used in this project comes primarily from two sources. The first is the [News API](https://newsapi.org/), and the second is collected with the support of the [Congress.Gov API](https://www.congress.gov/) and XML webscraping for the Bill text. Supplementary data includes the GOP and the DNC party platform documents, generated during the 2024 election cycle.
