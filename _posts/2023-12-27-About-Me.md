I am a student studying sociology, data science, education, and information science. My research interests are: human-centered data science accessible technology, and data generation and visualization. Read more about my experience and my undergraduate research work in my resume/CV or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-rm-castro?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=ios_app).


While attending the University of Colorado at Boulder, I found a love for information science! I felt that it combined sociology and data while still maintaining the human aspects the number represents. While I'm not studying, I love hiking and spending time outside!
