To save the topic model generated for Dr. David Glimp and Dr. Rachael Deagman Simonetta exploring politics in early modern texts, I developed documentation about how to serialize and push a model to HuggingFace.

View my Notion documentation to learn how to serialize and save a topic model. When should you save a model? Always! A BERTopic Model takes costly computatioal resources to run, and if you are building an analysis around it, it is important to develop a system to share and continue to build upon the trained model. This documentation was built upon the GitHub documentation built by Marteen Grootendorst, the creator of BERTopic.
