I am a (first year!) PhD student studying computer science at Northeastern University. I am interested in understanding how social systems are represented through digital systems, and specifically, how this impacts young people finding future opportunities. Read more about my prior research experience work in my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s7O6hNLyUA9vis3M58tvVzdTR4himDYX/view?usp=sharing) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-rm-castro?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=ios_app).


While attending the University of Colorado at Boulder, I found a love for information science! I felt that it combined sociology and data while still maintaining the human aspects the number represents. My Master's thesis was concerned with speculating on methods to increase the general accessibility of school board meetings through discourse analysis, traditional NLP methods, and AI NLP methods. While I'm not working, I love hiking, spending time outside, and practicing yoga!
