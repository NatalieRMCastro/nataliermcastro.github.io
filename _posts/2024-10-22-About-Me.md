  I am a current Master student studying information science. My research interests are: human-centered data science accessible technology, and data generation and visualization. Read more about my experience and my undergraduate research work in my [CV](https://drive.google.com/uc?export-download&id=1MHaec1qoOz3__RiJp_49P5g2rGOoWe4Y) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-rm-castro?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=ios_app).


  While attending the University of Colorado at Boulder, I found a love for information science! I felt that it combined sociology and data while still maintaining the human aspects the number represents. My Master's thesis is focusing on school districts in Colorado. I plan on generating a public facing data set of all school board meetings, their agendas, and transcripts in an accessible format. This will also generate a corpus of data for reserachers interested in school districts. To check out my progress, visit the [Github repository](https://github.com/CouncilDataProject/colorado-school-boards), and the website (coming soon!).  While I'm not studying, I love hiking and spending time outside!
