[Teaching Queerly: A Zine of Practice](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Ms4Mf5Fq6-_bXJasINnpAWz4gS9GxeZ/view?usp=sharing) was developed for my final project in Dr. Bethany Leonardi's Queer(ing) Topics in Education Class. As someone outside of the community, I wanted to provide a pedagogy primer based on the content learned in the course. This course taught me how to ask the right questions, consider positionality while teaching, and the role environment plays in a learning environment. This zine was prepared as my Queeruption. It was meant to challenge the heternormative stereotypes of a learning environment and teaching positionality within it. I believe that creating this resource illuminates the important scholars who have contributed to this work. I have provided a bibliography at the end of this post. 

Some of the images used in this document are AI generated. I chose to use these images to first abstain from using any stock photos of children, and also to capture a feeling unable to be found in stock images. The photo at the end of the zine with the post card saying "Queer + Happy", I took the photo myself in a small bookstore off of the Pike's Place market in Seattle. The photos of flowers were inteded to make the zine feel clean, fresh, and aesthetically pleasing. Also, they came from the Canva theme, and I rather liked them.

Please feel free to use this primer in any way you see fit, I would not like attribution. I believe this material should be freely shared because it is a result of contributions from many academics. If citing this primer, please use the below bibliography to continue to build upon these works. I am not affiliated with a [Queer Endeavor](https://www.colorado.edu/center/a-queer-endeavor/), Dr. Leonardi is the co-founder and co-director, but I reccommend any resource linked on their website any kinds of professional development and resources for teaching queerly.
