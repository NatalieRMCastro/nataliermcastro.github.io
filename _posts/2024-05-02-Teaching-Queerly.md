[Teaching Queerly: A Zine of Practice]() was developed for my final project in Dr. Bethany Leonardi's Queer(ing) Topics in Education Class. As someone outside of the community, I wanted to provide a pedagogy primer based on the content learned in the course. This course taught me how to ask the right questions, consider positionality while teaching, and the role environment plays in a learning environment. 

Please feel free to use this primer in any way you see fit, I would not like attribution. I believe this material should be freely shared because it is a result of contributions from many academics. If citing this primer, please use the below bibliography to continue to build upon these works. I am not affiliated with a [Queer Endeavor](https://www.colorado.edu/center/a-queer-endeavor/), Dr. Leonardi is the co-founder and co-director, but I reccommend any resource linked on their website any kinds of professional development and resources for teaching queerly.
