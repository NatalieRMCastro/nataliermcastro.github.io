was a presentation of my current MS thesis work. I shared my findings as a poster presentation during the first session of the conference. At this point, I was beginning to explore various traditional ways of Natural Language Processing, before my current focus on using AI augment the process. In addition to the amazing opportunity to share my work, I was able to received valuable feedback from experts in the subject as well. I look forward to being able to continue the conversations started at the conference, and hopefully attending IC2S2 soon!
