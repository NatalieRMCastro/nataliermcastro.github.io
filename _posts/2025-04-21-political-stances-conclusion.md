Climate chage is an increasingly salient issue, it is ubiqutious in its impact, however highly contentious. Those who reside in the Global South are dispropotionaley impacted by the policy and response to climate change from large companies who reside in the United States - especially those who outsouce their labor. For many, climate change is a daily concern, it results in housing inequality, shift in agriculture, and other daily aspects of well being. Across the world, 2024 was the hottest year on record. 

While tclimate change issues have developed over time, its severity and polarization has increased. After 2009, a clear partisian divide was idenitfied in response to the shift in President Barack Obama's climate policies - and the Republican Media campagain against it. Something similar may be observed in the current news cycle. While President Joe Biden recently granted the largest amount of monies in support of climate preservation policies, President Donald Trump, leading a Republican Trifecta has now pledged to repeal the Green Deal, and more recently impact the funding of many scientific funded agencies.

Posed at the start of this project were two central research questions:
1. How is climate change represented in climate policy passed as the federal level?
2. What ways does news coverage reflect polarization in regards to climate change?

These questions were explored through the lens of over 3,000 proposed climate bills and resolutions at the United States federal level in addition to over 800 news articles tagged with paritisan affiliations. Three different categories of text mining methods were applied to generate the following conclusions. 

### Key Findings

One has the pronunciation 'tomayto' the other 'tomahto'."  /></span> Party Polartization feels nearly akin to screaming different things at the same topic (cliamte change). Political polarization dictates views, and concerns often about similar things. Presented in this project is a closer understanding of what tangible polarization may look like. </p>

### Study Limitations


The findings generated here must be hedged with the natural limitations of these methods.
