Climate change is an increasingly salient issue, it is ubiqutious in its impact, however highly contentious. Those who reside in the Global South are dispropotionaley impacted by the policy and response to climate change from large companies who reside in the United States - especially those who outsouce their labor. For many, climate change is a daily concern, it results in housing inequality, shift in agriculture, and other daily aspects of well being. Across the world, 2024 was the hottest year on record. 

While tclimate change issues have developed over time, its severity and polarization has increased. After 2009, a clear partisian divide was idenitfied in response to the shift in President Barack Obama's climate policies - and the Republican Media campagain against it. Something similar may be observed in the current news cycle. While President Joe Biden recently granted the largest amount of monies in support of climate preservation policies, President Donald Trump, leading a Republican Trifecta has now pledged to repeal the Green Deal, and more recently impact the funding of many scientific funded agencies.

Posed at the start of this project were two central research questions:
1. How is climate change represented in climate policy passed as the federal level?
2. What ways does news coverage reflect polarization in regards to climate change?

These questions were explored through the lens of over 3,000 proposed climate bills and resolutions at the United States federal level in addition to over 800 news articles tagged with paritisan affiliations. Three different categories of text mining methods were applied to generate the following conclusions. 

### Key Findings

**Text Clustering**  
Clustering illustsrated the prevalence of the Environmental Protection Agency across all bills. The semantic distance between the language used for climate bills were demonstrated to be close to multiple topics suhc as 'greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide', 'lead and contaminated drinking water', or 'threatened wildlife and engaged species'. This prevalence demonstrates that the EPA is synonymolus with different facets of climate policy. Specific partisian differences were not identified through K-Means. This method demonstated different nuance within climate policy. The most prevalent topics helped to illustrate trends within climate policy over time in the United Stated. This trend was identified in both K-Means clustering and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The consistency across methods supports the accuracy of this finding. Through twenty different topics, it is clear that different concerns such as land, chemical regulations, and environmental factors illustrate the multiciplicty and different complexities of climate regulation. 

This trend is not illustrated as clearly for news sources. The largest clusters focused on President Donald Trump, with one cluster about the Los Angeles wildfire. Between the clusters, there was not as much overlap  between pnamed political entities and their partisian affiliation. For example, topics either focused soley on Donald Trump or Joe Biden. There was one exception to this trend with the topic name 'joe biden, job, trump, did'. An additional cluster generated through a different method illustrated paritisan overlap in two topics about the California wildfires and about offshore drilling. This was one of the smaller clusters, so it is a small exception to this.

### Study Implications

One has the pronunciation 'tomayto' the other 'tomahto'."  /></span> Party Polartization feels nearly akin to screaming different things at the same topic (cliamte change). Political polarization dictates views, and concerns often about similar things. Presented in this project is a closer understanding of what tangible polarization may look like. </p>

### Study Limitations


The findings generated here must be hedged with the natural limitations of these methods.
