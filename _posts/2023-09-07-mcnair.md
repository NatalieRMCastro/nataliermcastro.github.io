At this conference I spoke about "Education Policy and School Performance: A Data Driven Approach". This conference was an amazing opportunity to see undergraduate researchers in all fields ranging from physics to social sciences. Here, I had the change to present the preliminary findings of my Master's Thesis focusing on school districts in Colorado. </p>
