At this conference I spoke about "Education Policy and School Performance: A Data Driven Approach". This conference was an amazing opportunity to see undergraduate researchers in all fields ranging from physics to social sciences. Here, I had the change to present the preliminary findings of my Master's Thesis focusing on school districts in Colorado, and their board meetings. The first step in this process is to determine, __does school funding truly have an impact on student performance?__ 
		Well, the short answer to this question is no. By testing the correlations for funding and accreditation scores there is nothing that is statistically significant. This demonstrates the complexity of how a board functions, and its impact over the students.</p>
